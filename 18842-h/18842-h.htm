<h2>SAMUEL DANIEL</h2>


<p>Daniel's sonnet series has been by many regarded as the prototype of
Shakespeare's. It is true that several of Daniel's themes are repeated
in the cycle composed by the greater poet. The ideas of immortality in
verse, the transitoriness of beauty, the assurances of truth, the
humility and the woes of the lover, the pain of separation and the
comfort of night thoughts, shape the mood of both poets. But these
motives are also found in the pages of many other sonneteers of the
time. All these devotees seem to have had a storehouse of poetic
conceits which they held in common, and from which each poet had the
right to draw materials to use in his own way. In fact Shakespeare's
sonnets are full of echoes from the voices of Sidney, Constable, Davies,
Lodge, Watson,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span> Drayton and Barnes, as well as from that mellifluous one
of Daniel; and these poetic conceits were tossed forth in the first
place by the Italian sonnet makers, led by Petrarch. It is evident that
Daniel's <i>Petrarch</i> has been well-thumbed. Wood says that Daniel left
Oxford without a degree because "his geny" was "more prone to easier and
smoother studies than in pecking and hewing at logic," and we may
believe that Italian was one of these smoother studies. His translation
of Paolo Giovi's work on Emblems, which was published in 1585, was
doubtless one fruit of this study, a work that since it took him into
the very realm of the <i>concetti</i>, was to be a potent influence upon his
mental growth. The main theme, the cruelty of the Fair, is the same as
that of Petrarch. Daniel follows this master in making the vale echo
with his sighs, in appealing to her hand and cruel bosom for mercy, in
recounting the number of years he has worshipped her and honored her
with sonnets on which he is depending for immortal fame, in upbraiding
her for her devotion to the mirror rather than to him, and for ensnaring
him with the golden net of her hair and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> transpiercing him with the
darts from her crystalline eyes. In some of Petrarch's nobler flights
Daniel does not follow; the higher teachings of love are not revealed to
him, the step from human to divine he does not take; yet in the main,
the features of the earlier poet re-appear in Daniel's verse, as they do
in most of his fellow-sonneteers, including Shakespeare.</p>

<p>It is also not best to give too much weight to the opinion that
Shakespeare has been over-influenced by Daniel in the adoption of the
quatrain and couplet structure. The whole period from Wyatt to
Shakespeare shows a slow and steady mastery of the native over the
foreign tendency. The change was not a sudden leap on the part of Daniel
and Shakespeare, but a gradual growth occupying a half century and
culminating in the English form. But if we should feel convinced that
Shakespeare's memory was influenced by the sound of Daniel's cadences,
this need not be considered discreditable to Shakespeare. Daniel's lines
are smooth and melodious, and he was perhaps as great a master of the
technique of rhyme as was Shake<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>speare. If we take the sonnets of both
poets as criterion, the careful Daniel uses twice as many rhyme colours
as Shakespeare, while Shakespeare repeats rhymes twice as often as
Daniel. If double rhymes find less favor with the captious, we admit
that Daniel has a third more than Shakespeare has, but again Shakespeare
uses twice as many rhymes on syllables with secondary stress as does
Daniel, and Shakespeare's bad rhymes are as bad as Daniel's and more
frequent.</p>

<p>Daniel's poetic powers were appreciated to the full in his time. To his
contemporaries he was the "well languaged," the "sharp conceited," one
by whose verse Rosamond was eternised, one who "divinely sonnetted his
Delia." When Judicio in <i>The Return from Parnassus</i> makes his inventory
of poet's qualities, in giving his judgment on Daniel, he evidently has
the <i>Delia</i> in mind.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sweet honey-dropping Daniel doth wage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War with the proudest big Italian<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That melts his heart in sugared sonnetting."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If Jonson, Daniel's rival as maker of masques for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> the Court, proclaimed
him a good honest man but no poet, Spenser generously said he surpassed
"all that afore him came;" and scarcely one of the more prominent of his
contemporaries failed to address compliments to him. When Daniel was
gentleman extraordinary and groom of the privy chamber to Anne,
Queen-consort to James I., the Queen is said to have been a "favourer
and encourager of his muse;" and his high social position made it easy
for less favoured aspirants to praise him. But the perspective of time
brings a more balanced judgment. While Lowell finds in the fact that
Daniel was held in high esteem by his contemporaries a proof that noble
diction was appreciated then as now, and while he admits that Daniel
refined our tongue, yet he decided that Daniel had the thinking and
languaging parts of a poet's outfit but lacked the higher creative gift.
We shall find Daniel at his best, not when in prosaic soberness he sings</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"... the civil wars, tumultuous broils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bloody factions of a mighty land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>not when he is framing stilted tragedies with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span> chorus and declamation in
the grand Senecan manner, not in his complimentary addresses to lords,
ladies and royalty, nor in the classic masques and philosophical
dialogue, but in the less ambitious poems of <i>Delia</i> and <i>Rosamond</i>,
especially in such a sonnet as "Care-charmer Sleep," where we come more
near to hearing a human heart beat than in any of the others. It is not
a mighty heart, but it is one that is gentle, tender and pure.</p>

<p>A glance at the life of Daniel gives opportunity for an easy conjecture
as to the personality of the lady honoured under the name of Delia. At
seventeen Daniel was at Oxford, and finished a three years' residence at
Magdalen College in 1582. After a visit to Italy, he became established
at Wilton as tutor to the sons of Mary Sidney, Countess of Pembroke. To
those early days at Wilton the poet refers, when in 1603 he dedicates
his <i>Defense of Rhyme</i> to William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke, his former
pupil. In the introduction to this fine essay Daniel declares that in
regard to his poetic studies he was "first encouraged and framed
thereunto by your most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> worthy and honourable mother, and received the
first notion for the formal ordering of those compositions at Wilton
which I must ever acknowledge as my best school, and thereof always am
to hold a feeling and grateful memory." At this time the home of the
Herberts at Wilton was a literary centre. The Countess was herself an
industrious author, and the subject of innumerable dedicatory addresses.
She seems to have been as beautiful as she was gracious and gifted. In
the Penshurst picture we see her in extreme youth. The long oval and
delicate chiselling of the Sidney face are expressed in their finest
perfection, and justify the resemblance, found by Spenser, to "her
brother dear." The soft hair is of the same golden-brown as his, the
colour her eldest son inherited, and which Shakespeare is said to have
described in his figure of the marjoram-buds. In the picture by
Gheeraedts at the National Portrait Gallery, painted in 1614, she has
lost little of her youthful beauty, but has added the special graces of
maturity. The hair is still a rich brown. A thoughtful soul sits
brooding behind those attentive eyes&mdash;a soul that seems to wish to ask
the universal un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>answerable questions, one that has grappled with doubt
and struggled with environing circumstance, but has not yet consented to
be baffled. The face is modern and complex. This accomplished lady
received at Wilton the most distinguished people of her time. Her guests
included Spenser, Raleigh, probably Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Inigo
Jones, Sir John Harrington, Dr. Donne, and many more; and the Countess's
<i>Pastoral Dialogue in Praise of Astraea</i> was probably written in honour
of a visit from the Queen herself. It would perhaps be strange if the
young poet did not surround the personality of this fascinating
patroness with a romantic halo and feel that his poetic fame was linked
with hers. The Delia of the sonnets has all the excellencies that a
sonnet-honoured lady should have, including locks of gold. But the fact
that the poet has slyly changed the word "amber" to "snary" in sonnet
xiv., and "golden" to "sable" in sonnet xxxviii., looks as if he desired
to shield her personality from too blunt a guess. However, many hints
are given; she lives in the "joyful North," in "fair Albion;" she is</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The eternal wonder of our happy Isle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>And the river by which he sounds her name is the Avon&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But Avon, poor in fame and poor in waters,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Wiltshire Avon is the proud brook that flows southward by Wilton,
"where Delia hath her seat." If it may seem in any degree unfitting that
Daniel should address language so glowing as is found in the <i>Delia</i>
sonnets to a lady who is established as the head of a household with
husband and sons about her, attention may be called to the fact that the
sonnets, though they are characterised by warmth of feeling and
extravagance of expression, do not contain one tainted line. Posterity
must justify what Daniel in proud humility said of himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I <b>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; .</b><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><b>. &nbsp; . &nbsp; .</b> never had my harmless pen at all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distained with any loose immodesty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But still have done the fairest offices<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To virtue and the time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The respectful dignity of Daniel's prose dedication of <i>Delia</i> to Mary
Sidney cannot be surpassed; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> the introductory sonnet that displaces
it in the next edition, while confessing the ardent devotion of the
writer, is yet couched in the most reverent terms. Daniel and other
sonneteers had the great example of Petrarch in honouring a lady with
admiration and love expressed in verses whose warmth might perhaps not
have been so excusable, could the poet have been taken at his word. The
new sonnets inserted in the editions of 1601 and 1623 show the
faithfulness of the poet's homage. A loyal friendship, whether formed
upon gratitude only or upon some warmer feeling, inspired the <i>Delia</i>
although the poet expresses his devotion in the conventional modes. But
that Daniel outgrew to some extent the taste for these fanciful devices
is shown by the changes he made in successive editions. Four sonnets
from the 1591 edition were never reprinted, another was reprinted once
and afterwards omitted. In our text the order of the 1623 edition is
followed, the edition that was supervised by the poet's brother; but
these omitted sonnets will be found at the end under the head of
<i>Rejected Sonnets</i>. It is certain that they are Daniel's and that he
re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>jected them, and it therefore seems no more than fair to the poet, if
they are reprinted at all, to insert them under this head.</p>

<p>While, then, these rejected sonnets may have been in two cases omitted
by the poet because of their too great frankness of expression, in other
cases, notably in the phoenix, the wax-image, the tablet-and-siren, the
vanquished fort, and the ermelin sonnets, they seem to have lost their
charm, not so much for any personal reason as for the artistic defect in
the far-fetched nature of the device.</p>

<p>Daniel lived till 1619, experiencing the usual ups and downs in the
career of a "Court-dear poet." In later years, the famous Lady Anne
Clifford, wife of Mary Sidney's younger son, caused a monument to be
erected in his honour, in the inscription upon which she recorded her
pride in the fact that he had once been her tutor.</p>

<h2>HENRY CONSTABLE</h2>


<p>The sonnet-cycle in the hands of Henry Constable seems to have been in
the first place rather a record of a succession of "moment's monuments"
than a single dramatic scheme, even an embryonic one. The quaint preface
found in the Harleian transcript of the <i>Diana</i> shows this, and at the
same time tells what freedom was at that period allowed in the structure
and dove-tailing of a sonnet-cycle. It is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The Sonnets following are divided into 3 parts, each parte
contayning 3 several arguments and every argument 7 sonets.</p>

<p>"The first parte is of variable affections of love: wherein the
first 7 be of the beginning and byrth of his love; the second 7, of

<p>"The thyrd parte is tragicall, conteyning only lamentations:
wherein the first 7 be complaynts onlye of misfortunes in love, the

<p>The four sonnets to that distinguished "perticular," the King of
Scotland, seem to have won for the author a great deal of fame, for
Bolton mentions one of them as a witness to his opinion that "noble
Henry Constable was a great master in English tongue, nor had any
gentleman of our nation a more pure, quick, or higher delivery of
conceit." The King himself the poet is said to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> have met personally when
on his propagandist tours in Scotland; for Constable was an ardent Roman
Catholic, and spent most of his life in plots for the re-establishment
of that faith in England. Among the other "perticulars" addressed, the
Queen is of course bounteously favoured, and a number of ladies of her
Court are honoured; the series therefore lacks all pretense of unity. In
fact, the title of the 1594 edition declares that the "excellent
conceitful sonnets of Henry Constable" are "augmented with divers
quartorzains of honourable and learned personages;" and Sidney has been
found to be one of the "honourable and learned personages" whose works
were laid under contribution to make the book; but since the whole first
and second decades are the same as in the earlier volume by "H.C." which
contained also the King James sonnets attributed by numerous
contemporaries to Henry Constable, and since as yet, beside the ten by
Sidney, no more of the sonnets have by antiquarian research been traced
to their sources in the mazes of Elizabethan common-place books, it
seems but fair to leave the <i>Diana</i> of 1594 in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> hands of Constable.
All three books, the '92 and '94 editions and the manuscript volume,
show a like taste for orderly arrangement not found in general in the
sonnet-cycles.</p>

<p>Constable was a Cambridge man and was thirty years old when the <i>Diana</i>
was first printed. He lived until 1613 and bore an excellent reputation
in his day. He was the friend of Ben Jonson, who speaks of his
"ambrosaic Muse," of Sidney, Harington, Tofte, and other literary men.
If toying with the sonnet in <i>Diana</i> seems to indicate a light and
trifling spirit, we have to yield that with Constable as with Fletcher
the graver matters of state policy formed the chief interest in life to
the author. In Constable's case the interest was religious and the poet
was personally a man of devout feeling. Writing from the Tower, where
for a time he was detained, he says, "Whether I remain in prison or go
out, I have learned to live alone with God." At the conclusion of the
third part of the Harleian Miscellany transcript, the author says: "When
I had ended this last sonnet, and found that such vain poems as I had by
idle hours writ, did amount just to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> diametrical number 63,
methought it was high time for my folly to die, and to employ the
remnant of my wit to other calmer thoughts less sweet and less bitter."
It was probably in a mood like this that the poet turned from his
devotion to an earthly love and began to write his "Sonnets in honor of
God and his Saints." In this group, as in the other, he expresses that
passion for beauty characteristic of the renaissance, but here he shows
the lack of a clear conception as to where the line should be drawn
between earthly and heavenly beauty. In Constable we see the new
revelation barely emerging from the darkness, the human hand reaching
out in art toward the divine, but not knowing how to take and hold the
higher in its grasp. These sonnets are as "conceitful" as the others,
but the collection illustrates an early effort to turn the poetic energy
into a new field, to broaden the scope of subject-matter possible in
sonnet-form. The poet was evidently a close student of the
sonnet-structure. He used the Italian and the English form in about an
equal number of cases but he experiments on a large variety of
rime-arrangements besides.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>As to the personality honoured under the name of Diana, there seems to
be much obscurity. From the sonnet <i>To his Mistress</i>, we learn that
though he addresses several he loves but one.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grace full of grace, though in these verses here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My love complains of others than of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet thee alone I loved, and they by me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou yet unknown, only mistaken were."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So he loved her, it seems, while she was "yet unknown," something quite
possible in the sonneteer's world: and her personality, though shadowed
under various names, is to the poet a distinct conception. To the honour
of being this poet's inspirer, there are two claimants; one the Lady
Rich, the Stella of Sidney, the other the ill-fated Arabella Stuart. It
is noteworthy that the only one of all the sonnets addressed personally
to particular ladies that is retained in the edition of 1594, is one to
Lady Rich. But this sonnet tells us little except that "wish&egrave;d fortune"
had once made it possible for him to see her in all her beauty of roses
and lilies, stars and waves of gold: but this might have happened if he
had once seen that beauteous lady pass along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> the street in the queen's
glittering train. Other sonnets to or about the Lady Rich are equally
uncommunicative; and if the ill-starred Penelope Devereux is the one
alone that Constable loved, Time has shut the secret tightly in his
heart and will not give it up.</p>

<p>The other guess is but little nearer to certainty. During the years that
Constable was pursuing his shadowy schemes, Arabella Stuart was an
object of admiration and of political jealousy; the house where she
lived was constantly spied upon, her very tutors were suspected, the
wildest schemes were formed upon her royal connections, and it would not
be strange if the heart of our poetical zealot turned toward this star
of his cause. We may be sure that he would not have been averse to a
clandestine meeting, for in writing to that arch-plotter, the Countess
of Shrewsbury, Arabella's doting grandmother, he says: "It is more
convenient to write unto your Ladyship, than to come unto you or to make
any other visits either by day or night till I have further liberty
granted me;" besides this, the Earl of Shrewsbury was distantly related
to Constable's family, and this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> fact of kinship may have opened the
way; while his sonnet to the Countess intimates that his heart had been
touched by some beauty in her Venus' camp. If not Arabella, who could
this be?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To you then, you, the fairest of the wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And wisest of the fair I do appeal.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A warrior of your camp by force of eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Me prisoner took, and will with rigour deal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except you pity in your heart will place,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">At whose white hands I only seek for grace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As before, the sonnets addressed to Arabella give no definite
information. The first is in the usual strain of praise, and closes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"My drift was this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some earthly shadow of thy worth to show<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose heavenly self above world's reason is."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The second is as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Only hope of our age, that virtues dead<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By your sweet breath should be revived again;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Learning discouraged long by rude disdain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By your white hands is only cherish&egrave;d.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus others' worth by you is honour&egrave;d.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But who shall honour yours? Poor wits, in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We seek to pay the debts which you pertain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from yourself some wealth be borrow&egrave;d.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lend some your tongues, that every nation may<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In his own hear your virtuous praises blaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lend them your wit, your judgment, memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lest they themselves should not know what to say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that thou mayst be loved as much as praised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart thou mayst lend them which I gave thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The last of Constable's sonnets in the edition of 1592 is this
dedicatory address:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My mistress' worth gave wings unto my muse<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And my muse wings did give unto her name,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, like twin birds, my muse bred with her fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together now do learn their wings to use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in this book, which here you may peruse,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Abroad they fly, resolved to try the same<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Adventure in their flight; and thee, sweet dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both she and I for our protection choose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I by my vow, and she by farther right<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Under your ph&#339;nix (wing) presume to fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from all carrion beaks in safety might<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By one same wing be shrouded, she and I.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O happy, if I might but flitter there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where you and she and I should be so near."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The value of this author's praise, however, is somewhat impaired by the
extravagances in certain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> sonnets where, for instance, he honours a lady
whose soul, he says, was "endued in her lifetime with infinite
perfections as her divine poems do testify," when she on earth did sing
poet-wise angels in heaven prayed for her company, and when she died,
her "fair and glittering rays increased the light of heaven;" where
again he calls on the Countess of Essex to revenge the death of her
first husband, Sir Philip Sidney, upon the Spanish people by murdering
them <i>en masse</i> with her eyes, and where he calls the Countess of
Shrewsbury "chieftain of Venus's host," and places her crowned in heaven
beside the Virgin Mary. Constable's zealous publisher was not far wrong
when he claimed that in this poet "conceit first claimed his birthright
to enjoy," and since we do not find either in the sonnets to Lady Rich
or in those to Lady Arabella any special tone of sincerity that leads us
to have confidence in our conjecture, we shall be compelled to leave
this puzzle unsolved.</p>

<span class="i0">Fair by inheritance, whom born we see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Both in the wondrous year and on the day<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wherein the fairest planet beareth sway,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thou of a world of hearts in time shall be<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A monarch great, and with one beauty's ray<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So many hosts of hearts thy face shall slay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the rest for love shall yield to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But even as Alexander when he knew<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His father's conquests wept, lest he should leave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No kingdom unto him for to subdue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall thy mother thee of praise bereave;<br /></span>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
